Design Goals:
 - Turn based plan-n-go
 - Multiple paths, all with weaknesses
   - armies are limited, slow, expensive, but near unstoppable by non-armies
   - wizards are limited, expensive
   - diplomats are plentiful, but easy to manipulate
   - agents have no direct power, but can affect everything else
 - limited ability to give orders, scale up
 - The fun is in the planning, the choosing amongst the limitations

Hex map mechanics (done)
 - Map scales with players, at least Z hexes per player
 - Map supports ratio of players to regions
 - Regions are only roughly equal in size
 - Players are spread around as evenly as possible
 - Each region has one city (regional capitol)
 - Assign terrain based on player start locations and terrain preferences

Towns
 - city/town/hamlet starting values
 - buff player capitols

Game Mechanics (general guidelines)
 - troops and recruiting
   - players have kingdom troops
     - only available at capitol
     - only in limited supply. Maybe timed allotments.
   - regions have a troop type 
     - can only recruit at the city
     - must control the region
   - towns have generic troops
   - hamlets have no troops
 - towns
   - have a level: production, defense, diplomatic strength are all calculated from that.
 - figures
   - agents
     - can be purchased/created/trained
     - have a pop or army as a base of operations
     - can reach X hexes
     - agents have a proficiency level
     - missions
       - have a difficulty level
       - Roll 2 dice per proficiency level, 50% success per die, mission complete on success >= job level
       - adjustments for
         - counter agents
         - spells
   - diplomats
     - can be purchased/created/trained
     - have a pop as a base of operations
     - can reach X hexes
     - have a proficiency level
     - diplomatic actions
       - have a difficulty level
       - Roll 2 dice per proficiency level, 50% success per die, mission complete on success >= job level
       - adjustments for
         - counter diplomats
         - spells
         - population attitude
         - population loyalty
   - leaders
     - created in battle? maybe purchase the lowest level?
     - trained(advanced) only in battle
     - have a proficiency level
     - military bonuses
     - diplomatic ability
     - diplomacy power is the lesser of leader ability and army size
   - wizards
     - based in army or pop
     - have a proficiency level
     - training takes the place of casting a spell
     - one order a turn
     - spells
       - kingdom has an affinity (necro/nature/fire/etc)
       - can research to gain limited affinity elsewhere, giving a subset of the normal affinity list
 - Kingdoms
   - Unique spells lists
   - Unique level caps for training
   - Unique troop types

Fun things
 - Region names 
   - Based on dominant terrain type (e.g. Shrouded Forest)
   - City has a terrain oriented name (e.g. Oakdale)
 - figure names
   - based on race

Misc random thoughts
 - figure specialties? Spies might favor assassination, wizards a spell/genre, leaders grant some bonus (like extra movement).
 - create your own kingdom

Game Mechanics (specifics)
 - Diplomacy
   - map region borders = learn all locations that are in a region, but not what's on any of them.
   - Diplomat incite rebellion
     - automatic success on own pops (can't do own capitol)
     - "hits" = 1/level + roll 1 die/level where 50% of rolls add another hit (e.g. level 10 averages 15 hits: 10 + 0.5*10).
     - success if "hits" >= level of pop
     - mob activates if "hits" <= level/2
     - modifiers
       - embassy levels
       - counter emissary subtract their level from the inciting diplomat's "hits"
   - Diplomatic negotiate fealty
     - same as incite rebellion except as noted below
     - controlled pops have their level doubled for purposes of the attempt roll
   - non-friendly armies block movement
   - embassies
     - +level to owner's "hits" on diplomatic actions in pops
     - -level to others "hits" on diplomatic actions in owner's pops
     - Example: I have a level 2 embassy, they have level 1 => I'm +1 in their pops, they're -1 in mine
 - Battle
   - unit traits
     - use cases
       - high damage, high armor, low size => flexible, high longevity in the field
       - high damage, low armor, normal size => powerful, low longevity
       - low damage, high armor, normal size => defensive, high longevity
       - average damage, low armor, huge size => powerful, good longevity, but slow to heal
     - troop type
       - size: number of people in the troop
       - combat value: how many hits are inflicted in combat per person
       - armor: what percentage of opponent's hits do permanent damage
       - penetration: a bonus/reduction to the opponents armor
   - highest combat value wins
   - hits are evenly applied across all troops
   - units consolidate immediately (e.g. 5 units, 20% damage => 4 units), weakest is removed
   - combat strength calc
     - Per troop: size * combat value
 - Agents
   - non friendly armies do NOT block movement
   - missions
     - general
       - each mission has a difficulty factor
       - missions may promote an agent for success, depends on mission type
       - agent rolls "hits" just like diplomats
       - agent death chance is related to the difficulty factor
         - increased/reduced by the amount an agents succeeds or fails by
       - counter agents work just like counter diplomats
       - counter agent death possible if the mission succeeded, varies by mission type but generally as follows
         - roll attacking agent
         - roll defending agent
         - if attacker >= 2 * defender then defender dies
       - counter agents can promote if they made the difference in mission failure
     - assassination
       - difficulty based on the target type and level
     - recon
       - recon hex, full info on one square
       - recon embassies, X info on embassies in a region
       - explore region, identify X new hexes in the current region
     - sabotage
 - Wizards
   - non friendly armies do NOT block movement
 - Regional Control
     - 51% = controlled
       - free embassy level
       - diplomat thing? free level? free diplomat?
       - learn of all pops in the region
     - 80% && has city = dominated
       - towns and cities are +1/+2 level for combat if owned by the region owner
       - can recruit regional troops at the city
 - Armies
   - command structure
     - required:
       - normal: 1 per army + 1 per army unit. The goal is to have some additional penalty to having lots of little armies.
       - special: magical troops with no support cost
     - capacity:
       - +2 per Hamlet
       - +1 per town
       - -2 per City
   - cost
     - unit specific
     - kingdom adjustment
 - King
   - orders that are exclusive (policy orders)
     - increase power
     - improve embassy
     - take region census = know all pop center location in a region, knows their type, but no details

     - mapRegion=3 hamlets
     - takeCensus=3 hamlets
     - attempt=1 hamlet per 5 levels

       - modified by kingdom rates
       - kingdom based level caps
   - Armies
     - maintenance=0.5 hamlet/unit
       - modified by kingdom rates
     - recruit
       - kingdom=free, but limited
       - other=1.5 hamlets
     - create=2 hamlets
   - Pops
     - cost=2 hamlets
   - King stuff
     - improve power = 1 hamlet * (nextLevel / 4)
     - improve embassy in region = 3 hamlets;
 - Defaults
   - Goals
     - diplomats
       - level 1 diplomats can't do anything useful unless a pop has been hammered already
       - level 2 diplomats can do hamlets reliably
       - level 4+ diplomats can do towns reliably
       - level 8+ diplomats can do cities reliably
     - agents
       - agent/diplomat
         - can kill equal level agent/diplomat 50/50
       - wizards
         - level 0 wizard = 4 difficulty
         - level 1 wizard = 6 + level * 3
     - sabotage
       - pops: level 4 agent has 50/50
       - embassy: level 10 agent has 50/50
   - Hamlet = 3
   - Town = 6
   - City = 12


Map Display
 - See on each hex
   - what region it's in
   - pop on the hex
     - who owns the pop
     - whether things are known to be in the pop
     - pop type
   - armies in the hex
     - who owns the armies
   - terrain in the hex
 - concept
   - background is region color
   - terrain is transparent image (trees, mountains, etc)
   - center is a transparent image of the pop in the color of the owner
